Harms project machine learning

Using the keras library to develop a convolutional neural network that can predict which ligands bind ha and hb s100 proteins, and which ligands bind their most recent common ancestor.

Big picture: Exploring how binding affinity has changed between two modern protein and their most recent common ancestor
